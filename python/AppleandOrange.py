# Problem: Apple and Orange
# Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/apple-and-orange/problem
# Description:
# Sam's house is located between points s and t on the x-axis.
# There is an apple tree at point a and an orange tree at point b.
# Apples and oranges fall from their trees at various distances.
# Your task is to determine how many apples and oranges fall on Sam's house.
#
# Input:
# s - integer, start point of Sam's house
# t - integer, end point of Sam's house
# a - integer, location of the apple tree
# b - integer, location of the orange tree
# apples - list of integers, distances each apple falls from tree a
# oranges - list of integers, distances each orange falls from tree b
#
# Output:
# Two integers printed on separate lines:
# - Number of apples that fall on Sam's house
# - Number of oranges that fall on Sam's house
